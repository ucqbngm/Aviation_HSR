procedures of Air-HSR:

1) develop the demand forecasting model that contains a gravity model and and market share model (logit model)

2) predict domestic aviation demand with and without HSR

3) estimate capacity needed to meet the projected aviation demand 

4) calculate the lifecycle emissions inventories for both HSR and air transport

5) calculate the net lifecycle emissoins savings from the substitution of HSR for air transport in China.
