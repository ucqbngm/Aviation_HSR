procedures of Air-HSR:

1) develop the demand forecasting model that contains a gravity model and and market share model (logit model)

2) predict domestic aviation demand with and without HSR

3) estimate capacity needed to meet the projected aviation demand:
   - get declared capacity of each airport, calculate the annual total capacity of the airport;
   - estimate total flights needed to transport the demand;
   - calculate annual total ATMs (from both domestic and international flights) of each airport;
   - compare the total ATMs against the total capacity;
   - estimate when ATM will exceed capacity and how many extra runways will be needed. 

4) calculate the lifecycle emissions inventories for both HSR and air transport

5) calculate the net lifecycle emissoins savings from the substitution of HSR for air transport in China.
